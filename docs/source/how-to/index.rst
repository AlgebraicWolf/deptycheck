How-to guides
=============

How-to guides are *goal-oriented* (or *task-oriented*) pieces of the documentation.
They are intended for uses of the library aiming to solve some particular practical tasks using it.
They are recipes with particular setting and a clear goal.
It is good when one how-to guide gives enough info for solving a bunch of similar tasks.

You can read more in the `original framework <https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/>`_ about what how-to-guides are meant for.
