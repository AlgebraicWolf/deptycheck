=========

Tutorials are the *learning-oriented* pieces of the documentation.
They are intended for the new-comers, people who never used the library and want to give it the first try.
Tutorials' authors are fully responsible for the steps the learner gets through.

Tutorials are meant to be **satisfying**, **reproducible**, rather **simple** and very **concrete** lessons or recipes.
They should not contain much explanations, they should contain links to :any:`../explanation/index` instead.
You can read more in the `original framework <https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/>`_ about what tutorials are meant to be.
