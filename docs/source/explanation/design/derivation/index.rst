Design of automatic generators derivation
=========================================

.. staged derivation

.. derivation task (given/generated type arguments, external generators)

   .. incl. problem of target type with external generators without fuel pattern

.. distinction between type parameters and type indices,
   relativity of these terms to the derivation task

.. closure of (potentially) mutually recursive generators

   .. potential caching of generators of common types

.. design of single-type generator

.. design of constructor derivator, order and staff

   .. incl. different strategies of constructor derivators

      .. incl, least-effort and the company
