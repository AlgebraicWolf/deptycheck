==========================
Design of value generators
==========================

.. comparison to the design of QuickCheck and Hedgehog
   (in particular, in shrinking)

.. lack of Gen/Arbitrary distinction

.. ability to index possible generated values

.. close values (until shuffled) are likely to be similar (but still different)

.. finiteness of generators
