Things to be done
=================

.. end-user usability
   - entry-point functions for actual running (like ``quickcheck``, ``check``, ``forAll``, etc.)
   - smart comparison functions (like ``===``, ``shouldNotContain``, etc.)
   - nice violation diff printing of comparison functions

.. staff from limitations

.. explicit shuffling

.. support of shrinking or similar directed mutations

.. tuning of combinations of generators

.. proving or testing of laws of existing combination upon generators

.. co-generators or similar stuff for generation of functions;
   research of how this applies to dependently types functions
